        <p>Only a doctor can understand how tough it is to find the <b>Mbbs seats</b> in the <b>top medical colleges.</b> Believe me; that is a real fight. The route to the <b>medical degree</b> has a lot of ups and downs that nobody would ever tell you. There are certain things about the <b>medical education</b> that only you could understand and others can just fascinate how could you. You take up medical study as a normal human being but you come out as a completely different person; someone who enjoys holding those bleeding organs in his hands and has no fear of the living and the dead. Top of all, people start considering you next to the god when you yourself are in self-doubt and are looking for help. <b>Studying medicine</b> is funny sometimes, as there are things that no one else will understand about your life. Seriously, becoming a doctor isn’t easy. </p>

                <p class="text-upercase">From being alone in an anatomy class with dead bodies to talk to, to choosing a career path that demands nothing but just studies, eating, no sleep and lots of coffee, the study of mbbs bring forth many experiences that can only be understood by those who are pursuing it. I think all the doctors would completely relate to these funny sides of their profession. Read on for that perfect dose of laughter:</p>
