        <p>You know what’s interesting about <b>studying medicine</b>; it is the variety of people you come across. Yes, besides those anatomy sessions and different <b>medical courses</b>, this is the thing which makes the <b>medical training</b> a worthwhile experience for most aspiring doctors. Believe it or not but medical students are a completely different set of people. Often thought to be the most studious group, they are actually more than that. You will find a funny mixture of personalities in each of them and that’s what makes this long period of <b>medical study</b> a fun experience. So if you were of the idea that every other student in a <b>medical college</b> is a bookworm and has no life, then this post is for you. </p>
