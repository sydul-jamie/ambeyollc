        <p>Most toddlers when being asked what they want to become someday will answer, “To become a Doctor!” which is not surprising. At a toddler’s eye, being a doctor means taking care of kids, giving medicines and injections, having a stethoscope, and helping him to heal and be well.   It is evident from these young ones that becoming a doctor is a passion and a noble profession. That helping a person to heal and be well means being a doctor.</p>

                <p class="text-upercase">But do they become doctors? In reality, a small percentage of those toddlers will definitely take action to make their dream a reality while the others would pursue other professions.  If you are one these toddlers, then you must be ready to face all the challenges that you need to overcome to be able to bear in your name the title of M.D. or Doctor of Medicine.</p>

                <p class="text-upercase">Studying medicine is definitely for those who have a strong mind set to become one. If you would like to enter the medical field, you must not only be smart and science enthusiast, but you must be optimistic as well.  Optimism that will lead you to persevere and work hard.  Studying medicine is really a hard work and you must undergo phases of studies just to be accepted in a school of medicine.  Here in the Philippines, a student must be able to finish a pre-medical course before he would be able to apply for a university who offers a course on medicine. Yes, you have to take a pre-medical course. Just imagine the time and the money that you will spend in finishing a pre-medical course. And if you are lucky enough to graduate and pass an entrance exam for the course of medicine in one of the best or top universities in the Philippines that are offering it, you will spend additional years to get a degree of doctor of medicine.  Some years that you will undergo several tests to check if you are still on the track to finish your course, and another year to review before you take a board examination for doctors. Are those years studying medicine really worth it?  If you really have a passion of becoming a doctor, it will not be a bothering question.

                <p class="text-upercase">I personally applaud these students who study medicine and enjoying their course especially those who have limited funds to finish medicine and yet they are able to do so. There are many stories all over the internet on being poor yet they were able to finish medicine and pass the board examination. Among these stories, I have found their optimism more than a hundred percent of the others who have all the means to study medicine. Money is really essential to be able to earn a degree in medicine but if you are limited by it, would it hinder you to reach your dream of becoming a doctor?  Money must not dictate whether you will achieve your dream or not. It is your attitude that will matter. Money is not a hindrance to your dream. If you would really like to reach your dream of becoming a doctor, you must realize that there are many scholarship programs that you can look up to help you finance your needs while studying medicine. What these institutions offering medical scholarship programs require is for you to become a person of optimism, perseverance, and hard work.
