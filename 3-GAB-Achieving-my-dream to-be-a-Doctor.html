        <p>I always wanted to become a doctor. Maybe because it was of my compassion towards the sick or to see everyone around me happy that led me to pursue the career of becoming a professional medical practitioner, but it was the best decision in my life. I was always supported in this decision of going for <b>medical study</b> by my parents. So, I set myself to prepare for <b>MBBS admission</b> in a reputed medical college. While striving for the same, I observed that the cost of <b>medical study</b> in the <b>medical colleges in India</b> was comparatively higher than those in the Philippines. So, I started looking out for options to study MBBS <b>abroad</b>. There are several top-rated <b>medical colleges in Philippines</b> that offer <b>MBBS admission</b> at highly affordable <b>fees</b>.<br><br><b>Lyceum-Northwestern University –the College of My Dreams</b> </p>
