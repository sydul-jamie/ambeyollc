        <p>The <b>Philippines</b> is now known as one of the medical tourism countries around the globe. This despite being a country which is separated by thousands of islands and hundreds of dialects. But why is the <b>Philippines</b> visited often by international medical practitioners or undergoing <b>health studies</b> despite the fact that it is not as advance as the first world countries? They simply love the beautiful Filipinos.</p>

                <p class="text-upercase">The <b>Philippines</b> may be classified into two kinds of people, those who are in the urban and rural areas, and those who are still living behind mountains and center of the forests. There are many proofs that Filipinos are good, hospitable, friendly, and warm people. But most of them were based on the observation in urban and rural areas that were mostly visited by the foreigners.</p>

                <p class="text-upercase">There is far more beauty in these people at the ethnic areas of the <b>Philippines</b>, which are not often visited due to the problem with transportation and accommodation. But these people are often visited by foreign medical practitioners or <b>international students of medicine</b> in the Philippines and around the globe. These medical practitioners or medical students struggle long hours to be able to reach these ethnic groups who are mostly living in the secluded areas of the Philippines. And what purpose do they have in visiting these Filipinos? Most of them aim to undergo <b>medical training</b> and conduct studies on the health of these people who have limited or no medical access at all. Aside from these goal, they also help these group of Filipinos by giving aid to their common diseases, giving consultations, share some medicines, and be able to motivate and inform them of what may help them in terms of <b>medicine</b>. They do not only wish to help. They also enjoy every moment of living with these people. For every ounce of medicine that these health advocates give to these wonderful people, they are returned with every ounce of gratitude. Some of them are given with gifts which are mostly handmade, authentic, and rare, which are considered precious treasures of their ethnic group. In this case, these health advocates do not only give comfort but, on the other hand, they enjoy dealing with these Filipinos, living with them, enjoying simplicity with them. At these parts of the country, the traits of its people are remarkable and genuine.</p>

                <p class="text-upercase">In this sense, a foreign visitor can attest to the fact that the <b>Philippines</b> is a country of happy people. That regardless of whatever economic status, ethnicity, color, and health they have, they still strive, stand-up, and smile. Filipinos are the evidence of resiliency. Filipinos may be divided by mountains and water but their traits, may it be in urban, rural or far-away areas, are still the same. Despite health and economic issues, one can still feel their warm gratitude and can see their faces full of optimism. Genuine gratitude is rare and precious and these people can instantly share it with the people they get along with. For the medical practitioners and medical students all over the world, the Philippines does not only share its abundance in resources, but it also has people who do not contribute only in analyzing health issues but also give another motivation to strive hard in the medical field as well as in their personal lives.</p>
