        <p><b>Becoming a doctor</b> of medicine is one of the noblest and being looked up among other professions. But before someone <b>become a doctor</b>, he/she must conquer first the struggles on studying it. One of the struggles that a student of medicine faces is how to excel on this field. Of course, there are so many ways to excel in the field of medicine but only those who go beyond their comfort zone truly succeed. How does a medical student come out of his comfort zone? One is considering to <b>study abroad</b>. It is a common trend now in Asian countries that students leave their country to live in another country to study. But Why suffer being away from your loved ones just to pursue a <b>medical degree</b> which you can earn from your own country? The answer is vast. What I noticed is that motivated students who go beyond their horizon found desirable benefits on <b>studying medicine abroad</b>. The question now lies in what are the benefits of studying abroad? </p>

                <p class="text-upercase">COST EFFICIENT. It is one of the considerations before deciding whether to pursue medicine or not. Foreign students may find other countries tuition fees in <b>studying medicine</b> is lower than what is being offered in their country. The field of medicine being one of the expensive courses around the globe, students decide to enroll in one of the <b>top medical universities</b> in the country of its choice that offers low <b>medical college fee</b> but does not suffer their quality of education.</p>

                <p class="text-upercase">INDEPENDENCE, GROWTH, AND MATURITY. Foreign medical students conquer the other side of the world to enjoy and grow while studying one of the stressful courses across the globe. They enjoy living independently away from their families. As they learn to live on their own while doing a lot of memorization, paper works, case studies, and others, they grow as the days and weeks go by. To successfully conquer new challenges in a new environment, these students discover a part of themselves that they have not acknowledged when they were dependent on their families. As they discover, they do not only grow but they mature responsibly, which is one of the keys to becoming an effective and efficient soldier of medicine.</p>

                <p class="text-upercase">ACQUIRE DIFFERENT TECHNIQUES AND SKILLS. Foreign students leave their homes to study the <b>medical field</b> in another country, not for the sake of hiding themselves but they recognize the benefit of acquiring different techniques and skill, and new knowledge to help for their betterment. In this modern time when most of us rely on the power of our fingertips, there are still jobs that cannot be replaced by technology. Just like in the medical field, technology is a powerful tool but the skills and technique bring in by our five senses are irreplaceable. These techniques and skills differ from one country to another. That is one of the benefits of <b>studying medicine abroad</b>, to shape up techniques and skills which are not bounded in one country but may also be acquired from another one.</p>

                <p class="text-upercase">ADVANCEMENT. A wise student welcomes the idea that an advancement in the field of medicine is not limited on what he might have acquired in his country but to see the other side of another country, being able to study the health of their people and resources, and take it all for his advancement. He must not just seek for knowledge, but rather seek for advancement among the others that surround him. Medicine students must not be satisfied on what their country is offering. They need to go out their safe zone to acquire new information and advance studies that will greatly contribute to the current phase, situation or environment of their origin.</p>

                <p class="text-upercase">IMPART. Most of the foreign students after earning the title of MD, they go back to their countries. Whatever they have acquired, they bring it to their country to impart, apply, and contribute to their people. The thirst for advancement will always linger on the throat of the doctors of medicine but being able to contribute and shape up your society is a different achievement.</p>
