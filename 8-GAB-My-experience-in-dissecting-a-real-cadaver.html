        <p>As an aspiring doctor, the thoughts of <b>medical study</b> and its gross anatomy always kept me on my nerves. The idea of dissecting another human being is scary for a new medical student. Since, I always wanted to <b>study mbbs</b> so I was prepared for this phase of the <b>medical courses</b> even when its very thought gave me jitters every time. I had to face it bravely because it was not just the part of my <b>mbbs syllabus</b> but one of the crucial aspects of <b>studying mbbs abroad</b>, which was a dream come true for me. Also, when people come to know you are studying medicine, they start respecting you more and you become more motivated to work towards it. So, I had to overcome my fears.</p>

                <p class="text-upercase">Just like any other medical student, my experience of dissecting a real cadaver was no different. I was actually feeling confident in that prestigious medical lab coat. Surrounded by so many medical instruments, I was both terrified and nervous as well. Amidst that fearful silence, we were made to stand around eight to ten bodies, one for each group of ten students. That day I felt, the <b>study of mbbs</b> is for the braves. I was still in the panic state and was trying to cope up with the shocking sight of the cadaver for the first time when the scornful voice of our tutor asked us to proceed one by one. This made me think twice whether my decision of doing <b>medical study</b> was right or wrong.</p>

                <p class="text-upercase">Without a doubt, it was the most jittery part of my <b>medical education</b> at the <b>Lyceum-Northwestern University.</b> Standing close to the dead body, which was embalmed, we were asked to evaluate it. Not being able to raise our heads and look towards that motionless body, we were weak to perform any activity. Yet, gradually, one by one, we started it off with a little confidence. And, what we witnessed was a real first glance of our own selves. Then, after regaining all my high-spirits, I approached the specimen with a boost. It was truly a one of a kind experience. The day “one” of this part of a <b>medical study</b> was a bit difficult but once we became used to these lab sessions, things got interesting.</p>

                <p class="text-upercase">Studying the anatomy of a human body at <b>Lyceum-Northwestern University</b> was a great learning experience, which made me explore my own internal functionality. From limbs, vital organs, skull, torso, heart, chest cage to lungs and teeth, we were made to examine each part closely. Though the toughest part of the <b>mbbs syllabus</b>, it was the most thrilling experience of my entire <b>medical study</b>. It not just made me confident but fearless as well. This encouraged me to put my best efforts in my study and gave me the confidence to take up any challenge without any hesitation.</p>

                <p class="text-upercase">Well, on a positive note, my experience of dissection wasn’t a pleasant one initially, but I learned a lot of things about myself and uncovered many mysteries of a <b>medical study</b> with this one encounter. All this has made me respect my medical profession more! Hats off to the doctors!</p>
